       "[\"These are my first pair of Crocs and it was love at first try-on! I bought the basic Classic ones which I read are supposed to fit pretty loosly. The toe box is perfect for my wide feet and allows my toes to spread. There is just the right amount of space in front of my toes. The instep is maybe tighter than I read it is supposed to fit. I have a high instep and what is called a full foot. The shoe is not tight but there is contact with my foot all across the area between the holes on top and the foot opening. It's not uncomfortable or tight at all but I read the fit is supposed to be such that your foot does not touch the shoe here. I also wonder if they would cause blisters. From what I read there is supposed to be space here between your foot and the shoe. If I wore socks they would need to be thin ones.Second thing is when I received them I tipped them out of the bag onto my hard floor. (I am still cautious about packaging due to Covid concerns so this is just the way I do things.) I noticed the next day that the spot where they landed on the floor is now really slick.

       " 'In the past I purchased foam slides from Walmart for not much money.  They are comfortable and wear well enough for a couple of seasons before the foam begins to break down.  I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.  Yet other colours like this Tangerine colour seems to run 2 sizes too small.',\n",

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.

If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.  Yet other colours like this Tangerine colour seems to run 2 sizes too small.',\n",

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

       " 'In the past I purchased foam slides from Walmart for not much money.  They are comfortable and wear well enough for a couple of seasons before the foam begins to break down.  I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

       " 'In the past I purchased foam slides from Walmart for not much money.  They are comfortable and wear well enough for a couple of seasons before the foam begins to break down.  I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.  Yet other colours like this Tangerine colour seems to run 2 sizes too small.',\n",

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

       " 'In the past I purchased foam slides from Walmart for not much money.  They are comfortable and wear well enough for a couple of seasons before the foam begins to break down.  I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.

I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.

I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.

I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.

I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

       " 'In the past I purchased foam slides from Walmart for not much money.  They are comfortable and wear well enough for a couple of seasons before the foam begins to break down.  I decided I might try Crocs for a better fit and greater longevity.  In really good quality shoes I wear 8.5 B.  Crocs are said to run a bit large, so I ordered down to 8 instead of up to 9.The quality looks pretty good.  I think they would last longer than the cheapies I previously purchased at Walmart, but I had to send back the size 8.  The length was not too bad, but the width was too wide.  With the strap down, the strap does not hold my foot in at all.  Price has gone up again, but once it goes back down, I will try a 7.  If size 7 proves too small, then I will stick to the cheapies at Walmart.  No real arch support in these shoes, either.  For the price point, I expected a better fit.  I cannot speak to how comfortable they are because I had to return the size 8.  If I ever find size 7 for a good price, I will update my review with regard to comfort.I awarded 4 out of 5 stars because overall they are nicer quality than what I purchased at Walmart, but I would never pay more than $30 TOPS for these.  The higher prices are inflated.  I suppose they can do that because these shoes are popular with younger people for some reason.  I think they are quite unattractive looking shoes, but as a senior, I care far more about comfort than I do about beauty.  If a pair would wear well for at least three years, then they are definitely worth $30 but no more than that in my opinion.14 August 22 ETA:This amendment is for a size 8 in the colour Tangerine.Firstly, let me mention that they changed the colour name on these from Orange to Tangerine.  They are definitely orange and do NOT resemble the shoe colour in the photo labelled Tangerine.  Okay, that is not a big deal to me for $25.The big deal is that getting the correct size on these shoes is a crap shoot.  I have ordered Navy size 8 that were too big, and now this Tangerine colour is size 8 is much too small.  This fits more like a size 6.  I do not think even someone who wears a size 7 could wear these comfortably.  Now, they will have to go back.  I am SO TIRED of having to send stuff back.  It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.

It is a waste of my time, energy, and petrol.  It is also wear and tear on my vehicle.  I do try to drop things off at the UPS store at the same time I have other errands to run in town, but it does not always coincide with other errands.  Not sure now if I should order a 9 or a 10 or just forget it.I have read literally HUNDREDS of reviews of these shoes, and MANY reviewers say they shrink if they get wet and/or if they are left outside in hot weather or left inside of a motor vehicle.  Not just a few reviewers have mentioned this.  Plenty of reviewers have mentioned it.  I think it is entirely possible that this pair has shrunk.As I said, ordering these shoes is a crap shoot depending on in which country they were made and what colour they are.  Some colours, like Navy, seem to run a size large.  Other colours like Pepper seem to run a bit small for an 8 but can work.
